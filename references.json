Several\nresearchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require\nperformance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to\nshow using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD\ncan be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called\nHOGWILD! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility\nof overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization\nproblem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the\ndecision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence.\nWe demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms alternative schemes\nthat use locking by an order of magnitude.",

GSN is a recently proposed deep learning\ntechnique (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) to globally train deep generative\nmodel. We present the supervised extension of GSN, which learns a Markov chain\nto sample from a conditional distribution, and applied it to protein structure\nprediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional data, like\nprotein sequences with hundreds of amino acids, we introduce a convolutional\narchitecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers of\nhierarchical representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predicting\nstructured low-level labels informed with both low and high-level\nrepresentations learned by the model. In our application this corresponds to\nlabeling the secondary structure state of each amino-acid residue. We trained\nand tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous proteins sharing less\nthan 30% sequence identity.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent\nperformance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large\nlabeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to\nsequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence\nlearning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method\nuses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to\na vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the\ntarget sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to\nFrench translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by\nthe LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's\nBLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did\nnot have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT\nsystem achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM\nto rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its\nBLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on\nthis task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations\nthat are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and\nthe passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in\nall source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance\nmarkedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the\nsource and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.",

    "abstract": "We present a library of efficient implementations of deep learning\nprimitives. Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and\noptimizing their kernels is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel\narchitectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized, which makes maintaining\ncodebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the\nHPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).\nHowever, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a\nlibrary, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel\nprocessors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main\ncomputational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel\nprocessors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar\nin intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our\nimplementation contains routines for GPUs, although similarly to the BLAS\nlibrary, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library\nis easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized\nperformance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a\npopular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a\nstandard model while also reducing memory consumption.",

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole\nensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to\nallow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual\nmodels are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it\nis possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which\nis much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different\ncompression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show\nthat we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used\ncommercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a\nsingle model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more\nfull models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained\nclasses that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these\nspecialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",

Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain\nadaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved,\npredictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the\ntraining (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea\nin the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data\nfrom the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled\ntarget-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach\npromotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main\nlearning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the\nshift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be\nachieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard\nlayers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture\ncan be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent,\nand can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning\npackages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct\nclassification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification),\nwhere state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is\nachieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the\ncontext of person re-identification application.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging large historical data in electronic health record (EHR), we\ndeveloped Doctor AI, a generic predictive model that covers observed medical\nconditions and medication uses. Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) and was developed and applied to longitudinal time\nstamped EHR data from 260K patients over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g.\ndiagnosis codes, medication codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to\npredict (all) the diagnosis and medication categories for a subsequent visit.\nDoctor AI assesses the history of patients to make multilabel predictions (one\nlabel for each diagnosis or medication category). Based on separate blind test\nset evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential diagnosis with up to 79%\nrecall@30, significantly higher than several baselines. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting\nmodels from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy.",

Using a simple parallelization\nscheme for stochastic gradient descent, SparkNet scales well with the cluster\nsize and tolerates very high-latency communication. Furthermore, it is easy to\ndeploy and use with no parameter tuning, and it is compatible with existing\nCaffe models. We quantify the dependence of the speedup obtained by SparkNet on\nthe number of machines, the communication frequency, and the cluster's\ncommunication overhead, and we benchmark our system's performance on the\nImageNet dataset.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of data size and accessibility in recent years has\ninstigated a shift of philosophy in algorithm design for artificial\nintelligence. Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn\ncomposable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to\nground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision,\nspeech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of\ntechniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing\nsignificant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible\namounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for\nbetter hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and\nmodel sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics\nprocessing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current\ntrends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the\nhigh-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning\ncommunity, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.\nSince FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the\nability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed\narchitectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per\nwatt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application\nscientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or\nresource-limited embedded applications. This review takes a look at deep\nlearning and FPGAs from a hardware acceleration perspective, identifying trends\nand innovations that make these technologies a natural fit, and motivates a\ndiscussion on how FPGAs may best serve the needs of the deep learning community\nmoving forward.",

We also propose\na method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions\nand their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular\noptimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by\nexplaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image\nclassification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via\nnovel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios\nthat require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between\nmodels, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier\nshould not be trusted.",

    "abstract": "Since microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene\nregulation, miRNA identification is one of the most essential problems in\ncomputational biology. miRNAs are usually short in length ranging between 20\nand 23 base pairs. It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding\nsequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar\nlength, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs\ninstead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional\nmachine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they\noften have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,\nand their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmiRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural\nnetworks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene\nautomatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual\nfeature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect\nstructural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation\nof our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on\nthree recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered\ncomparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.",

For some\napplications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and\nexpensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm\nfor the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which\nusers express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling\nfunctions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are\nnoisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training\nset labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated\ntraining set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of\nthese generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a\ndiscriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method\nover a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.\nExperimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data\nprogramming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying\ndata programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points\nover a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the\ncompetition).

    "abstract": "Parallelization framework has become a necessity to speed up the training of\ndeep neural networks (DNN) recently. Such framework typically employs the Model\nAverage approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct\nrespective training based on their own local data while the parameters of local\nmodels are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model\nwhich serves as the new start of local models. However, since DNN is a highly\nnon-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can\nperform better than those local models. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnew parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN.\nIn this framework, we propose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e.,\naveraging the outputs of local models instead of the parameters. As most of\nprevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of\nensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average\nperformance of local models. However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of\nmodel size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size\nincrement. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble,\nspecialized by a distillation based method in this paper, to reduce the size of\nthe global model to be the same as the local ones. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate the prominent advantage of EC-DNN over MA-DNN in terms of both\naccuracy and speedup.",

In\ntime series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing\nvalues and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels,\na.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the\nmissing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.\nIn this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of\nthe early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a\nstate-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of\nmissing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates\nthem into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term\ntemporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to\nachieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification\ntasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and\nprovides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing\nvalues in time series analysis.",

Computational methods that predict gene expression\nfrom histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their\ncombinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing\n'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying\nthe relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels\neither failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods\nthat separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a\nunified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to\nclassify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system,\ncalled DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among\nimportant features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions\namong histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique\nthat generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides\nan intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate\ngenes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models\nlike Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression\nclassification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database.

Second, considering recurrent models make predictions in\na temporal manner (from one end of a TFBS sequence to the other), we introduce\ntemporal output scores, indicating the prediction score of a model over time\nfor a sequential input. Lastly, a class-specific visualization strategy finds\nthe optimal input sequence for a given TFBS positive class via stochastic\ngradient optimization.

At train-time the quantized weights and activations are used for\ncomputing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, QNNs drastically\nreduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with\nbit-wise operations. As a result, power consumption is expected to be\ndrastically reduced. We trained QNNs over the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and\nImageNet datasets. The resulting QNNs achieve prediction accuracy comparable to\ntheir 32-bit counterparts. For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with\n1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves $51\\%$ top-1 accuracy. Moreover,\nwe quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients\ncomputation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks\nwere tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as\ntheir 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed\na binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our\nMNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering\nany loss in classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for\nautomated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of\nconventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and\nuses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that\nis most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14\nEnglish-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive\nresults to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of\nisolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%\ncompared to Google's phrase-based production system.",

    "abstract": "We propose a technique for producing \"visual explanations\" for decisions from\na large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach -\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of\nany target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a\ncoarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for\npredicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a\nwide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.\nVGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in\ntasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any\narchitectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained\nvisualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization\nand apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual\nquestion answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the\ncontext of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights\ninto their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have\nreasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform\nprevious methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to\nthe underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset\nbias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention\nbased models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure\nif GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep\nnetworks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a\n\"stronger\" deep network from a \"weaker\" one.

Using\nBernoulli dropout with sampling at prediction time has recently been proposed\nas an efficient and well performing variational inference method for DNNs.\nHowever, sampling from other multiplicative noise based variational\ndistributions has not been investigated in depth. We evaluated Bayesian DNNs\ntrained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units\n(dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We tested the calibration of the\nprobabilistic predictions of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on\nMNIST and CIFAR-10. Sampling at prediction time increased the calibration of\nthe DNNs' probabalistic predictions. Sampling weights, whether Gaussian or\nBernoulli, led to more robust representation of uncertainty compared to\nsampling of units. However, using either Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to\nincreased test set classification accuracy. Based on these findings we used\nboth Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which we show\napproximates the use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution without\nincreasing the number of learned parameters. We found that spike-and-slab\nsampling had higher test set performance than Gaussian dropconnect and more\nrobustly represented its uncertainty compared to Bernoulli dropout.",

To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention\nModel, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical\ninformation inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the\nontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its\nancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism.

Compared to\nthe basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely\nobserved in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for\npredicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.\nAdditionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned\nby GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology.

    "abstract": "One of the most difficult speech recognition tasks is accurate recognition of\nhuman to human communication. Advances in deep learning over the last few years\nhave produced major speech recognition improvements on the representative\nSwitchboard conversational corpus. Word error rates that just a few years ago\nwere 14% have dropped to 8.0%, then 6.6% and most recently 5.8%, and are now\nbelieved to be within striking range of human performance. This then raises two\nissues - what IS human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech\nrecognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have\nalready achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we\nperformed an independent set of human performance measurements on two\nconversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably\nbetter than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly\nharder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area,\npresenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the\nword error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the\nlevel of 5.5%/10.3% on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000\nevaluation, which - at least at the writing of this paper - is a new\nperformance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!).\nOn the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of three models: one LSTM with\nmultiple feature inputs, a second LSTM trained with speaker-adversarial\nmulti-task learning and a third residual net (ResNet) with 25 convolutional\nlayers and time-dilated convolutions.

We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs.\naleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For\nthis we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent\naleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models\nunder the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or\ncheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular\ndocking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and\nbinding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models\nrequire expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded\nas hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model\nto select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general\n3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical\ninteractions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application\nto structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural\nnetwork is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of\na protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with\nthe complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding\npose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the\nprotein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the\ninteraction strength associated with these features. We test our model by\npredicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes\nfound in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics\nand machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve\nexperimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform\nor perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all\nprevious protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are\nend-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven,\nphysics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for\nfuture improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.",

This paper evaluates a custom\nASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)---deployed in datacenters since\n2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of\nthe TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak\nthroughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed\non-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to\nthe 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are\nthe time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order\nexecution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average\nthroughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps\nexplain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively\nsmall and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and\nan Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters.\nOur workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production\nNN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters'\nNN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is\non average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with\nTOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the\nTPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and\n200X the CPU.",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of membrane protein (MP) structures is very\nchallenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology\nmodeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light\non protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but\nDCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses\ninformation only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep\ntransfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction\nby learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from\nthousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,\nour deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact\nprediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)\nand much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11\nwinner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further\nimproved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts\nin transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range\naccuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by\nnon-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV\n(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure\nrelationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP\ncontact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better\ncontact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our\ndeep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore>0.6 when\ntrained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while\nCCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our\ncontact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.",

A tremendous\nnumber of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are\naccumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and\nCommunication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question\nhow this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging\ninformatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry\ndeep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems.\n  In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely \"ChestX-ray8\",\nwhich comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients\nwith the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have\nmulti-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language\nprocessing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic\ndiseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified\nweakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization\nframework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial\nquantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural\nnetwork based \"reading chest X-rays\" (i.e., recognizing and locating the common\ndisease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task\nfor fully-automated high precision CAD systems.

    "abstract": "Biomedical events describe complex interactions between various biomedical\nentities. Event trigger is a word or a phrase which typically signifies the\noccurrence of an event. Event trigger identification is an important first step\nin all event extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either\nrely on complex hand-crafted features or consider features only within a\nwindow. In this paper we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent\nneural network (RNN) to extract higher level features present across the\nsentence. Thus hidden state representation of RNN along with word and entity\ntype embedding as features avoid relying on the complex hand-crafted features\ngenerated using various NLP toolkits. Our experiments have shown to achieve\nstate-of-art F1-score on Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have\nalso performed category-wise analysis of the result and discussed the\nimportance of various features in trigger identification task.",

Experiments on two public benchmarking datasets, AIMed and BioInfer,\ndemonstrate that McDepCNN compares favorably to the state-of-the-art\nrich-feature and single-kernel based methods. In addition, McDepCNN achieves\n24.4% relative improvement in F1-score over the state-of-the-art methods on\ncross-corpus evaluation and 12% improvement in F1-score over kernel-based\nmethods on \"difficult\" instances. These results suggest that McDepCNN\ngeneralizes more easily over different corpora, and is capable of capturing\nlong distance features in the sentences.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a\nflood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to\nunderstand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale\nchromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning\ntasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured,\nhigh-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what\nare the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either\nfailed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate\nfeature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an\nattention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a\nunified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin\nfactors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of\nmultiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and\nto model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome\ntrains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it\nto attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions\nper mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in\nhuman. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention\nscores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature\nvisualization methods such as saliency map.\n  Code and data are shared at www.deepchrome.org",

A Bayesian hypernetwork $\\h$ is a neural network\nwhich learns to transform a simple noise distribution, $p(\\vec\\epsilon) =\n\\N(\\vec 0,\\mat I)$, to a distribution $q(\\pp) := q(h(\\vec\\epsilon))$ over the\nparameters $\\pp$ of another neural network (the \"primary network\")\\@. We train\n$q$ with variational inference, using an invertible $\\h$ to enable efficient\nestimation of the variational lower bound on the posterior $p(\\pp | \\D)$ via\nsampling. In contrast to most methods for Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian\nhypernets can represent a complex multimodal approximate posterior with\ncorrelations between parameters, while enabling cheap iid sampling of~$q(\\pp)$.\nIn practice, Bayesian hypernets can provide a better defense against\nadversarial examples than dropout, and also exhibit competitive performance on\na suite of tasks which evaluate model uncertainty, including regularization,\nactive learning, and anomaly detection.",

We argue that this\nimposes a limitation on their representation power, and instead propose a new\ngeneral architecture for representing objects consisting of a hierarchy of\nparts, which we call Covariant Compositional Networks (CCNs). Here, covariance\nmeans that the activation of each neuron must transform in a specific way under\npermutations, similarly to steerability in CNNs. We achieve covariance by\nmaking each activation transform according to a tensor representation of the\npermutation group, and derive the corresponding tensor aggregation rules that\neach neuron must implement.

DNA methylation is\nimplicated in various biological processes and diseases including cancer. Hence\nthere is a strong interest in understanding the DNA methylation patterns across\nvarious epigenetic related ailments in order to distinguish and diagnose the\ntype of disease in its early stages. In this work, the relationship between\nmethylated versus unmethylated CpG regions and cancer types is explored using\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

To this end, computer vision approaches have been applied to cell segmentation and feature extraction, whereas machine-learning approaches have been developed to aid in phenotypic classification and clustering of data acquired from biological images. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly used computer vision and machine-learning methods for generating and categorizing phenotypic profiles, highlighting the general biological utility of each approach.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we use deep architectures pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using denoising autoencoders as a preprocessing step for a popular unsupervised learning task. Denoising autoencoders (DA) can be used to learn a compact representation of input, and have been used to generate features for further supervised learning tasks. We propose that our deep architectures can be treated as empirical versions of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). We use our deep architectures to regenerate gene expression time series data for two different data sets.

However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.</jats:p>",

Due to their ability to discover patterns in large and complex data, the introduction of deep learning methods enables a significant advance in our knowledge of the genomic locations of cis-regulatory regions. Using models for well-characterized cell lines, we identify key experimental features that contribute to the predictive performance.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments are commonly used to obtain genome-wide profiles of histone modifications associated with different types of functional genomic elements. However, the quality of histone ChIP-seq data is affected by a myriad of experimental parameters such as the amount of input DNA, antibody specificity, ChIP enrichment, and sequencing depth. Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.  Results: We introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs. More broadly, this approach -- using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process -- is generally applicable to other biological domains where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To extract patterns from neuroimaging data, various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms have been explored for the diagnosis of Alzheimer′s disease among older adults in both clinical and research applications; however, distinguishing between Alzheimer′s and healthy brain data has been challenging in older adults (age &gt; 75) due to highly similar patterns of brain atrophy and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge deep learning technologies have rapidly expanded into numerous fields, including medical image analysis. This paper outlines state-of-the-art deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimer′s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) from normal healthy control data for a given age group. Using these pipelines, which were executed on a GPU-based high-performance computing platform, the data were strictly and carefully preprocessed. Next, scale- and shift-invariant low- to high-level features were obtained from a high volume of training images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this study, fMRI data were used for the first time in deep learning applications for the purposes of medical image analysis and Alzheimer′s disease prediction. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate a significant improvement in classification output over other studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 99.9% and 98.84% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Additionally, for clinical purposes, subject-level classification was performed, resulting in an average accuracy rate of 94.32% and 97.88% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Finally, a decision making algorithm designed for the subject-level classification improved the rate to 97.77% for fMRI and 100% for MRI pipelines.</jats:p>",

To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.</jats:p>",

Our approach trains a deep feed-forward neural network with semi-simulated data. Semi-simulated datasets are constructed by planting somatic mutations in real datasets where no mutations are expected. Using semi-simulated data makes it possible to train the models with millions of training examples, a usual requirement for successfully training deep learning models. We initially focus on calling variations in RNA-Seq data. We derive semi-simulated datasets from real RNA-Seq data, which offer a good representation of the data the models will be applied to. We test the models on independent semi-simulated data as well as pure simulations. On independent semi-simulated data, models achieve an AUC of 0.973. When tested on semi-simulated exome DNA datasets, we find that the models trained on RNA-Seq data remain predictive (sens ~0.4 &amp; spec ~0.9 at cutoff of P&gt;=0.9), albeit with lower overall performance (AUC=0.737). Interestingly, while the models generalize across assay, training on RNA-Seq data lowers the confidence for a group of mutations. Haloplex exome specific training was also performed, demonstrating that the approach can produce probabilistic models tuned for specific assays and protocols. We found that the method adapts to the characteristics of experimental protocol. We further illustrate these points by training a model for a trio somatic experimental design when germline DNA of both parents is available in addition to data about the individual.

Statistical tools have been developed to analyze individual data types, but there lack strategies to integrate disparate datasets under a unified framework. Moreover, most analysis techniques heavily rely on feature selection and data preprocessing which increase the difficulty of addressing biological questions through the integration of multiple datasets. Here, we introduce FIDDLE (Flexible Integration of Data with Deep LEarning) an open source data-agnostic flexible integrative framework that learns a unified representation from multiple data types to infer another data type. As a case study, we use multiple Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic datasets to predict global transcription start sites (TSS) through the simulation of TSS-seq data. We demonstrate that a type of data can be inferred from other sources of data types without manually specifying the relevant features and preprocessing. We show that models built from multiple genome-wide datasets perform profoundly better than models built from individual datasets. Thus FIDDLE learns the complex synergistic relationship within individual datasets and, importantly, across datasets.</jats:p>",

In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images  and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0%-20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space.

Although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, it is still largely unclear to what extent the sequence-level information encoded in our genome help guide such interactions. Here we report a new computational method (named \"SPEID\") using deep learning models to predict enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. Our results across six different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that only use information from a single cell type. As a proof-of-principle, we also applied SPEID to identify somatic non-coding mutations in melanoma samples that may have reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in tumor genomes. This work demonstrates that deep learning models can help reveal that sequence-based features alone are sufficient to reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide.</jats:p>",

Despite more than a decade of effort and thousands of dedicated researchers, the hand-crafted and parameterized statistical models used for variant calling still produce thousands of errors and missed variants in each genome. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the \"highest performance\" award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical modeling towards more automatic deep learning approaches for developing software to interpret biological instrumentation data.</jats:p>",

These models were developed by training deep neural networks with semi-simulated data. In this continuation, I evaluate how such models can predict known somatic mutations in a real dataset. To address this question, I tested the approach using samples from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and the previously published ground-truth mutations (GoldSet). This evaluation revealed that training models with semi-simulation does produce models that exhibit strong performance in real datasets. I found a linear relationship between the performance observed on a semi-simulated validation set and independent ground-truth in the gold set (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.952, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 2<jats:sup>−16</jats:sup>). I also found that semi-simulation can be used to pre-train models before continuing training with true labels and that this pre-training improves model performance substantially on the real dataset compared to training models only with the real dataset. The best model pre-trained with semi-simulation achieved an AUC of 0.969 [0.957-0.982] (95% confidence interval) compared to 0.911 [0.890-0.932] when training with real labels only. These data demonstrate that semi-simulation can be a very effective approach to training filtering and ranking probabilistic models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Design: EMR and OCT database study Subjects: Normal and AMD patients who had a macular OCT. Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. Main outcome measure: Area under the ROC. Results: Of a recent extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal macular OCT images and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques achieve high accuracy and is effective as a new image classification technique. These findings have important implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and the development of computer aided diagnosis tools in the future.</jats:p>",

The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task.

Traditional methods requires great effort to annotate the training data by costly manual labeling and specialized computational models to detect these annotations during test. Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram without the aforementioned costly need to annotate the training data. We explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for whole mammogram classification.

In double-stranded DNA, the same pattern may appear identically on one strand and its reverse complement due to complementary base pairing. Here, we show that conventional deep learning models that do not explicitly model this property can produce substantially different predictions on forward and reverse-complement versions of the same DNA sequence. We present four new convolutional neural network layers that leverage the reverse-complement property of genomic DNA sequence by sharing parameters between forward and reverse-complement representations in the model. These layers guarantee that forward and reverse-complement sequences produce identical predictions within numerical precision. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo transcription factor binding data, we show that our proposed architectures lead to improved performance, faster learning and cleaner internal representations compared to conventional architectures trained on the same data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction and show that it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over-expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.\n\nAvailability: code and data will be available on Github following publication.</jats:p>",

Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill in this gap, we present a deep learning (DL) based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We build the DL based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and methylation data from TCGA, which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P=7.13e-6) and good model fitness (C-index=0.68). More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19, EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n=230, C-index=0.75), NCI cohort (n=221, C-index=0.67), Chinese cohort (n=166, C-index=0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n=40, C-index=0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n=27, C-index=0.82). This is the first study to employ deep learning to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of HCC patients. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction.</jats:p>",

A crucial step in transcript assembly is to accurately determine the splicing junctions and boundaries of the expressed transcripts from the reads alignment. In contrast to the splicing junctions that can be efficiently detected from spliced reads, the problem of identifying boundaries remains open and challenging, due to the fact that the signal related to boundaries is noisy and weak.\n\nResults: We present DeepBound, an effective approach to identify boundaries of expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads alignment. In its core DeepBound employs deep convolutional neural fields to learn the hidden distributions and patterns of boundaries. To accurately model the transition probabilities and to solve the label-imbalance problem, we novelly incorporate the AUC (area under the curve) score into the optimizing objective function. To address the issue that deep probabilistic graphical models requires large number of labeled training samples, we propose to use simulated RNA-seq datasets to train our model. Through extensive experimental studies on both simulation datasets of two species and biological datasets, we show that DeepBound consistently and significantly outperforms the two existing methods. \n\nAvailability: DeepBound is freely available at https://github.com/realbigws/DeepBound. \n\nContact: mingfu.shao@cs.cmu.edu, realbigws@gmail.com</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to give rise to cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term 'neural network' suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.</jats:p>",

Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and cell types, querying binding profiles of all TF/cell type pairs is not experimentally feasible, owing to constraints in time and resources. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional-recurrent neural network model, called FactorNet, to computationally impute the missing binding data. FactorNet trains on binding data from reference cell types to make accurate predictions on testing cell types by leveraging a variety of features, including genomic sequences, genome annotations, gene expression, and single-nucleotide resolution sequential signals, such as DNase I cleavage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning method to study the rules governing TF binding at such a fine resolution. With FactorNet, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay, such as DNase-seq, on a cell type and computationally impute dozens of TF binding profiles. This is an integral step for reconstructing the complex networks underlying gene regulation. While neural networks can be computationally expensive to train, we introduce several novel strategies to significantly reduce the overhead. By visualizing the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory grammar. We also investigate the variables that affect cross-cell type predictive performance to explain why the model performs better on some TF/cell types than others, and offer insights to improve upon this field. Our method ranked among the top four teams in the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Neuroscience is experiencing a data revolution in which simultaneous recording of many hundreds or thousands of neurons is revealing structure in population activity that is not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from trial-averaged data. Single-trial analyses are challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. Here we introduce Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. LFADS uses a nonlinear dynamical system (a recurrent neural network) to infer the dynamics underlying observed population activity and to extract ‘de-noised’ single-trial firing rates from neural spiking data. We apply LFADS to a variety of monkey and human motor cortical datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict observed behavioral variables with unprecedented accuracy, extract precise estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infer perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combine data from non-overlapping recording sessions (spanning months) to improve inference of underlying dynamics. In summary, LFADS leverages all observations of a neural population's activity to accurately model its dynamics on single trials, opening the door to a detailed understanding of the role of dynamics in performing computation and ultimately driving behavior.</jats:p>",

Peptides bound to MHCs are recognized by CD8+ (MHC Class I) and CD4+ (MHC Class II) T-cells. Successful prediction of which peptides will bind to specific MHC alleles would benefit many cancer immunotherapy applications. Currently, supervised machine learning is the leading computational approach to predict peptide-MHC binding, and a number of methods, trained using results of binding assays, have been published. Many clinical researchers are dissatisfied with the sensitivity and specificity of currently available methods and the limited number of alleles for which they can be applied. We evaluated several recent methods to predict peptide-MHC Class I binding affinities and a new method of our own design (MHCnuggets). We used a high-quality benchmark set of 51 alleles, which has been applied previously. The neural network methods NetMHC, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, and MHCnuggets achieved similar best-in-class prediction performance in our testing, and of these methods MHCnuggets was significantly faster. MHCnuggets is a gated recurrent neural network, and the only method to our knowledge which can handle peptides of any length, without artificial lengthening and shortening. Seventeen alleles were problematic for all tested methods. Prediction difficulties could be explained by deficiencies in the training and testing examples in the benchmark, suggesting that biological differences in allele-specific binding properties are not as important as previously claimed. Advances in accuracy and speed of computational methods to predict peptide-MHC affinity are urgently needed. These methods will be at the core of pipelines to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapy, based on tumor-derived somatic mutations. Machine learning methods, such as MHCnuggets, which efficiently handle peptides of any length will be increasingly important for the challenges of predicting immunogenic response for MHC Class II alleles.</jats:p>",

Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method \"Tybalt\" after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific activated expression patterns that would result from genetic changes or treatment effects.</jats:p>",

We apply this method to combine STRING networks to construct a common low-dimensional representation containing high-level protein features. We use separate layers for different network types in the early stages of the multimodal autoencoder, later connecting all the layers into a single bottleneck layer from which we extract features to predict protein function.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Computational prediction of cell type-specific, in-vivo transcription factor binding sites is still one of the central challenges in regulatory genomics, and a variety of approaches has been proposed for this purpose. Here, we present our approach that earned a shared first rank in the \"ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge\" in 2017. This approach employs features derived from chromatin accessibility, binding motifs, gene expression, genomic sequence and annotation to train classifiers using a supervised, discriminative learning principle. Two further key aspects of this approach are learning classifier parameters in an iterative training procedure that successively adds additional negative examples to the training set, and creating an ensemble prediction by averaging over classifiers obtained for different training cell types. In post-challenge analyses, we benchmark the influence of different feature sets and find that chromatin accessiblity and binding motifs are sufficient to yield state-of-the-art performance for in-vivo binding site predictions. We also show that the iterative training procedure and the ensemble prediction are pivotal for the final prediction performance. To make predictions of this approach readily accessible, we predict 682 peak lists for a total of 31 transcription factors in 22 primary cell types and tissues, which are available for download at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11526239, and we demonstrate that these may help to yield biological conclusions. Finally, we provide a user-friendly version of our approach as open source software at http://jstacs.de/index.php/Catchitt.</jats:p>",

Co-evolution methods show promise, but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive. Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end-to-end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here we report the first end-to-end differentiable model of protein structure. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and in the second it comes within 1-2Å; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</jats:p>",

Lost data can be an obstacle to downstream analyses that require complete data matrices. State-of-the-art imputation techniques including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based methods usually achieve good performances, but are computationally expensive especially for large datasets such as those involved in pan-cancer analysis. Results: This study describes a new method: a denoising autoencoder with partial loss (DAPL) as a deep learning based alternative for data imputation. Results on pan-cancer gene expression data and DNA methylation data from over 11,000 samples demonstrate significant improvement over standard denoising autoencoder for both data missing-at-random cases with a range of missing percentages, and missing-not-at-random cases based on expression level and GC-content. We discuss the advantages of DAPL over traditional imputation methods and show that it achieves comparable or better performance with less computational burden.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Histopathology defines the gold standard in oncology. Automatic analysis of pathology images could thus have a significant impact on diagnoses, prognoses and treatment decisions for cancer patients. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown strong performance in computational histopathology tasks. However, given it remains intractable to process pathology slides in their entirety, CNNs have traditionally performed inference on small individual patches extracted from the image. This often requires a significant amount of computation and can result in ignoring potentially relevant spatial and contextual information. Being able to process larger input patches and locating discriminatory regions more efficiently could help improve both computational and task specific performance. Inspired by the recent success of Deep Recurrent Attention Models (DRAMs) in image recognition tasks, we propose a novel attention-based architecture for classification in histopathology. Similar to CNNs, DRAMs have a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation performed can be controlled independently from the input image size. The model is a deep recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning to attend to the most relevant areas of large input patches. We evaluate our model on histological and molecular subtype classification tasks for the glioma cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our results suggest that the DRAM has comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNNs despite only processing a select number of patches.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>DNA methylation has been extensively linked to alterations in gene expression, playing a key role in the manifestation of multiple diseases, most notably cancer. For this reason, researchers have long been measuring DNA methylation in living organisms. The relationship between methylation and expression, and between methylation in different genomic regions is of great theoretical interest from a molecular biology perspective. Therefore, several models have been suggested to support the prediction of methylation status in samples. These models, however, have two main limitations: (a) they heavily rely on partially measured methylation levels as input, somewhat defeating the object as one is required to collect measurements from the sample of interest before applying the model; and (b) they are largely based on human mediated feature engineering, thus preventing the model from unveiling its own representations. To address these limitations we used deep learning, with an attention mechanism, to produce a general model that predicts DNA methylation for a given sample in any CpG position based solely on the sample's gene expression profile and the sequence surrounding the CpG.</jats:p><jats:p>We show that our model is capable of generalizing to a completely separate test set of CpG positions and subjects. Depending on gene-CpG proximity conditions, our model can attain a Spearman correlation of up to 0.8 and MAE of 0.14 for thousands of CpG sites in the test data. We also identify and analyze several motifs and genes that our model suggests may be linked to methylation activity, such as Nodal and Hand1. Moreover, our approach, and most notably the use of attention mechanisms, offers a novel framework with which to extract valuable insights from gene expression data when combined with sequence information.</jats:p><jats:p>The code and trained models are available at: <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/YakhiniGroup/Methylation\">https://github.com/YakhiniGroup/Methylation</jats:ext-link></jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We focus on the new problem of determining which methylation patterns in gene promoters strongly associate with gene expression in cancer cells of different types. Although a number of results regarding the influence of methylation on expression data have been reported in the literature, our approach is unique in so far that it retrospectively predicts the combinations of methylated sites in promoter regions of genes that are reflected in the expression data. Reversing the traditional prediction order in many cases makes estimation of the model parameters easier, as real-valued data are used to predict categorical data, rather than vice-versa; in addition, our approach allows one to better assess the overall influence of methylation in modulating expression via state-of-the-art learning methods. For this purpose, we developed a novel neural network learning framework termed E<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>M (Expression-to-Methylation) to predict the status of different methylation sites in promoter regions of several bio-marker genes based on a sufficient statistics of the whole gene expression captured through Landmark genes. We ran our experiments on unquantized and quantized expression sets and neural network weights to illustrate the robustness of the method and reduce the storage footprint of the processing pipeline.</jats:p>",

Here we survey the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human brain. We identified thousands of somatic SNVs by single-cell sequencing of 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals. Unlike germline and cancer SNVs, which are often caused by errors in DNA replication, neuronal mutations appear to reflect damage during active transcription. Somatic mutations create nested lineage trees, allowing them to be dated relative to developmental landmarks and revealing a polyclonal architecture of the human cerebral cortex. Thus, somatic mutations in the brain represent a durable and ongoing record of neuronal life history, from development through postmitotic function.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We compare and contrast genome-wide compositional biases and distributions of short oligonucleotides across 15 diverse prokaryotes that have substantial genomic sequence collections. These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes.</jats:p>",

We present an unsupervised machine learning approach, ADAGE (\n                    <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>\n                    nalysis using\n                    <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>\n                    enoising\n                    <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>\n                    utoencoders of\n                    <jats:italic>g</jats:italic>\n                    ene\n                    <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>\n                    xpression), and apply it to the publicly available gene expression data compendium for\n                    <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>\n                    . In this approach, the machine-learned ADAGE model contained 50 nodes which we predicted would correspond to gene expression patterns across the gene expression compendium. While no biological knowledge was used during model construction, cooperonic genes had similar weights across nodes, and genes with similar weights across nodes were significantly more likely to share KEGG pathways. By analyzing newly generated and previously published microarray and transcriptome sequencing data, the ADAGE model identified differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes based on low-level gene expression differences. ADAGE compared favorably with traditional principal component analysis and independent component analysis approaches in its ability to extract validated patterns, and based on our analyses, we propose that these approaches differ in the types of patterns they preferentially identify. We provide the ADAGE model with analysis of all publicly available\n                    <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>\n                    GeneChip experiments and open source code for use with other species and settings. Extraction of consistent patterns across large-scale collections of genomic data using methods like ADAGE provides the opportunity to identify general principles and biologically important patterns in microbial biology. This approach will be particularly useful in less-well-studied microbial species.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                     <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>\n                    The quantity and breadth of genome-scale data sets that examine RNA expression in diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species are increasing more rapidly than for curated knowledge. Our ADAGE method integrates such data without requiring gene function, gene pathway, or experiment labeling, making practical its application to any large gene expression compendium. We built a\n                    <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>\n                    ADAGE model from a diverse set of publicly available experiments without any prespecified biological knowledge, and this model was accurate and predictive.

Various machine learning-based approaches have been applied to BNER tasks and showed good performance. In this paper, we systematically investigated three different types of word representation (WR) features for BNER, including clustering-based representation, distributional representation, and word embeddings. We selected one algorithm from each of the three types of WR features and applied them to the JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE II BNER tasks. Our results showed that all the three WR algorithms were beneficial to machine learning-based BNER systems. Moreover, combining these different types of WR features further improved BNER performance, indicating that they are complementary to each other. By combining all the three types of WR features, the improvements in<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-measure on the BioCreAtIvE II GM and JNLPBA corpora were 3.75% and 1.39%, respectively, when compared with the systems using baseline features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the effect of three different types of WR features for BNER tasks.</jats:p>",

Previous theoretical and practical focuses were restricted on traditional machine learning techniques. However, these methods are susceptible to the issues of<jats:italic> “vocabulary gap”</jats:italic> and data sparseness and the unattainable automation process in feature extraction. To address aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a multichannel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for automated biomedical relation extraction. The proposed model has the following two contributions: <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> it enables the fusion of multiple (e.g., five) versions in word embeddings; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> the need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning with convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated our model on two biomedical relation extraction tasks: drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction and protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction. For DDI task, our system achieved an overall <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-score of 70.2% compared to the standard linear SVM based system (e.g., 67.0%) on DDIExtraction 2013 challenge dataset. And for PPI task, we evaluated our system on Aimed and BioInfer PPI corpus; our system exceeded the state-of-art ensemble SVM system by 2.7% and 5.6% on <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-scores.</jats:p>",

Single-cell approaches circumvent the averaging artifacts associated with traditional bulk population data, yielding new insights into the cellular diversity underlying superficially homogeneous populations. Thus far, single-cell RNA-sequencing has already shown great effectiveness in unraveling complex cell populations, reconstructing developmental trajectories, and modeling transcriptional dynamics. Ongoing technical improvements to single-cell RNA-sequencing throughput and sensitivity, the development of more sophisticated analytical frameworks for single-cell data, and an increasing array of complementary single-cell assays all promise to expand the usefulness and potential applications of single-cell transcriptomic profiling.</ns4:p>",

This review focuses on five important metagenomic problems:OTU-clustering, binning, taxonomic proffiing and assignment, comparative metagenomics and gene prediction. For each of these problems, we identify the most prominent methods, summarize the machine learning approaches used and put them into perspective of similar methods.We conclude our review looking further ahead at the challenge posed by the analysis of interactions within microbial communities and different environments, in a field one could call “integrative metagenomics”.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which pancreatic β cells are killed by infiltrating immune cells and by cytokines released by these cells. This takes place in the context of a dysregulated dialogue between invading immune cells and target β cells, but the intracellular signals that decide β cell fate remain to be clarified. Alternative splicing (AS) is a complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism affecting gene expression. It regulates the inclusion/exclusion of exons into mature mRNAs, allowing individual genes to produce multiple protein isoforms that expand the proteome diversity. Functionally related transcript populations are co-ordinately spliced by master splicing factors, defining regulatory networks that allow cells to rapidly adapt their transcriptome in response to intra and extracellular cues. There is a growing interest in the role of AS in autoimmune diseases, but little is known regarding its role in T1D. In this review, we discuss recent findings suggesting that splicing events occurring in both immune and pancreatic β cells contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D. Splicing switches in T cells and in lymph node stromal cells are involved in the modulation of the immune response against β cells, while β cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines activate complex splicing networks that modulate β cell viability, expression of neoantigens and susceptibility to immune-induced stress. Unveiling the role of AS in β cell functional loss and death will increase our understanding of T1D pathogenesis and may open new avenues for disease prevention and therapy.</jats:p>",

However, it is rare for researchers to perform or publish direct replications of existing results. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is an open investigation of reproducibility in preclinical cancer biology research. We have identified 50 high impact cancer biology articles published in the period 2010-2012, and plan to replicate a subset of experimental results from each article. A Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for each subset of experiments will be peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The results of these experiments will then be published in a Replication Study. The resulting open methodology and dataset will provide evidence about the reproducibility of high-impact results, and an opportunity to identify predictors of reproducibility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.</jats:p>",

The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The output of a classifier should be a calibrated posterior probability to enable post-processing. Standard SVMs do not provide such probabilities. One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA growing body of literature supports the ability of specific foods and nutrients to impact the gastrointestinal microbiome. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the interplay of dietary components (e.g. foods and nutrients), gastrointestinal bacteria, and bacterial metabolites. Current analytical approaches limit investigation of these complex interrelations; therefore, further research utilizing modern machine learning methods is needed.ObjectiveWe aimed to fill the gap in knowledge about the interrelationship of diet, the gastrointestinal microbiome, and health by utilizing multivariate approaches that address P>>N, many features but few samples to 1) validate results generated by prototype software with previously published results; and 2) identify novel associations among relevant foods, nutrients, bacteria, and bacterial metabolites.MethodsData generated from a human dietary intervention study that included habitual food and nutrient intake patterns (NHANES food frequency questionnaire), daily dietary intake records, breath gas, and fecal bacteria and metabolite data were analyzed using machine learning approaches. Relevant bacteria, bacterial metabolites, foods, and nutrients were identified using Random Forest and relationships among these relevant features were determined using Maximal Information Coefficient.ResultsBreath hydrogen and agave inulin supplementation were predictive of Bifidobacterium abundance. Habitual diet factors were highly relevant in predicting participant body mass index (BMI). Among bacteria, Phascolarctobacterium, Collinsella, and Erysipelotrichacea were important features for predicting BMI. Oscillospira was associated with habitual dietary glycemic load. Phascolarctobacterium and Eubacterium were associated with habitual intake of deep yellow vegetables. Dietary polyunstaruated fatty acids were relevant in predicting Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratios. Total fiber and butyrate were highly relevant in predicting Faecalibacterium abundance.ConclusionsFindings revealed similar associations among diet, bacterial genera, and breath hydrogen measures as previously published results, thereby validating the use of these methods in diet-microbiome studies. BMI, bacterial abundances, dietary fiber intake, glycemic load, and deep yellow vegetable intake were interrelated. As features of a high quality diet were relevant for predicting bacterial abundances and metabolites, additional work is ongoing to calculate healthy eating index scores. These scores will help delineate purported health benefits (or detriments) of dietary components, bacteria, and bacterial metabolites and aid in identifying targets for future diet-microbiome studies.Support or Funding InformationThis study was partially funded by the Illinois Applied Research Institute.",

    "abstract": "Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art results in a variety of settings, especially with vision datasets. Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work",

    "abstract": "Extracting adverse drug events receives much research attention in the biomedical community. Previous work adopts pipeline models, firstly recognizing drug/disease entity mentions and then identifying adverse drug events from drug/disease pairs. In this paper, we investigate joint models for simultaneously extracting drugs, diseases and adverse drug events. Compared with pipeline models, joint models have two main advantages. First, they make use of information integration to facilitate performance improvement; second, they reduce error propagation in pipeline methods. We compare a discrete model and a deep neural model for extracting drugs, diseases and adverse drug events jointly. Experimental results on a standard ADE corpus show that the discrete joint model outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline pipeline significantly. In addition, when discrete features are replaced by neural features, the recall is further improved.",

    "abstract": "We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and malicious settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offerscommunication expansion forusers and-dimensional vectors, andexpansion for\n\nusers and-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.",

    "abstract": "Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.",

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.",
